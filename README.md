# 2D Game Engine Comparison For Rapid Prototyping For Anyone

## Introduction
I've always wanted to build my own game but had *zero* knowledge about this area. Game engines have advanced so much that *most people* can now put something reasonably impressive together for fun (or profit) *without too much effort*. [This post](https://farawaytimes.blogspot.com/2023/02/how-to-make-good-small-games.html?m=1) inspired me to dive in.

### What does this repo offer me?
There are an overwhelming number of game engines to pick from so here is:
* A **2023** shortlist for *anyone* to try out that are all **free**
* Links to get you started
* The same playable game for each engine to make it easy to compare (created by following the links provided)
* The source code for each game

### Selection criteria
I've been a software engineer since about 2007 and although I can code in a variety of languages I wanted something that *anyone* could pick up so these are the key criteria for inclusion:
* **Free** (you can build a good game without being forced to upgrade to premium versions). Open Source is a bonus
* Good documentation
* Good community
* Under active development
* Easy **visual scripting** (so you don't need to learn how to code)
* Support working in a **common and useful programming language** (so you can teach yourself coding at the same time or not feel limited by the visual scripting)
* Easy to use editor
* Supports exporting to **HTML5** (since this is an easy format to host and share, e.g. free hosting on https://itch.io/games)
 
For total beginners 2D games are much simpler to build than 3D games. If you're interested in **3D games** I would create a few 2D prototypes first and pick the game engines I've marked as supporting 3D.

My **personal website** can be found [here](http://johnduncanscott.github.io/personal-website/).

## Summary
**GDevelop** is probably the one you should start with. If you feel limited, move to **Unity** but expect a steep learning curve. I've personally decided to stick with **Unity** (despite the 2023 pricing fiasco) as it's powerful and I like C#, plus some of my friends are using this.

## Comparison
See **Details** below to clarify some of the ratings. See the **Notable games** and **Showcase** below for what's possible.

* **Key**
  * ‚≠ê - excellent (very few flaws)
  * ‚úÖ - good (flaws but overall pleasant experience)
  * üÜó - average (mixed experience)
  * üò°- poor (easy to find flaws, overall negative experience)
  * ‚ùå- not supported

### Details

#### GDevelop
Overall good fun to use and quick to get up and running for a total beginner. **Recommended**.

Key parts are free and there are useful free services. Documentation is easy to find, up-to-date and there are extensive videos. There's an active community that's a reasonable size. Editor on mobile is limited but on desktop and web it's unrestricted. Editor supports grouping, comments and colours for organisation plus the preview is instant. HTML5 builds are unlimited but you only get a few per day for other platforms, but this is probably manageable. Can download extensions in the IDE to build things faster (e.g. add controller support) and you can add your own. IDE has built-in guided lessons. Reasonable selection of free assets.

Console builds are not supported. Can't use other editors for JavaScript coding (e.g. VSCode). Multiplayer isn't an out of the box experience. Have access to P2P protocols but it's up to you to get multiplayer working how you want. This extension supposedly alleviates that but quality is unknown - https://gdevelop.io/blog/make-multiplayer-games-easily. Specialises in 2D games; 3D games can be made through extensions but are in an early state, but is being developed rapidly. Although 2D is a speciality it lacks advanced features like skeletal animations. Tilemaps could be a bit more clever. Some of the older tutorials haven't been updated for the new IDE and have a few minor errors. IDE provides reasonable autocomplete but improvements can be made here. No support for organising things in folders so careful naming of game objects and using tags is essential. Could do with more free assets, especially sounds & music.

#### Unity
Overall very powerful but at the expense of being complicated and having many unpolished features. Would recommend you start with **GDevelop** first then migrate to this if you feel limited. You might choose this first if you want:
* To learn a solid backend programming language (static typing will give you nicer errors than JavaScript and switching to Java later is also easy)
* To learn a battle-tested popular game engine (**Unreal Engine** is its main competitor)
* You want something that won't limit you (but may frustrate you)

The important parts are free (unless you want to release to consoles). API documentation and the community is good. There is a full learning track but it's mostly for 3D. Excellent external editors (e.g. `Visual Studio`) are easy to setup and are a must if not using visual scripting. Massive selection of free assets. Very powerful and has many tools (e.g. smart tiling, skeletal animations, solid particle system, etc.). Good for 2D and 3D although the 2D isn't really specialised (just a modified view of the 3D world, which you might prefer if you want to mix and match). Multiplayer is available. 

Initially found it hard to make progress because there's so much to learn. It took **4x** as long as **GDevelop** to learn enough and build the equivalent game, although I feel the Unity one is more polished. This is not helped by the fact that many of the official tutorials are designed for specific versions, so expect mistakes or bugs when not using the exact one. In addition the **2D** tutorials are poor at teaching you the fundamentals (stick to YouTube). The vast majority of tutorials (both official and unofficial) focus on coding rather than visual scripting. It's not too tricky to convert between them, but you may find it tricky to get started if you want to only focus on visual scripting. In the end I chose to follow C# ones and then try some visual scripting which was nice enough (much of the C# is copy / pasting anyway so you'll probably be ok). Many annoyingly unpolished features (e.g. "2d game kits" left to rot, version mismatch issues, default WebGL template doesn't stretch properly, etc. - too many to list, also see https://garry.net/posts/unity-2020). The editor is complicated to get to grips with initially. Projects are slow to open.

If you would like to get started faster then there a few packages in the **Optional** section that could be good.

##### 2023 pricing fiasco
* https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/oldest-unity-game-developer-group-breaks-up-over-lack-of-trust-in-the-company/
* https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-67063855

Ultimately, all companies need to make money but they did a bad job with this one. At least the CEO quit. This has made me a bit more cautious, but I'm still sticking with Unity because overall it is a good tool and ultimately anything you pick that's free might have similar changes.

### GDevelop
[Playable game for the source code in this repository](https://duncanscott.itch.io/2d-platformer-demo-gdevelop)

#### Getting started
1. **Basics**
   * https://gdevelop.io/academy
     * [YouTube - Beginner's Guide To GDevelop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=595-swNh0Mw&list=PL3YlZTdKiS89Kj7IQVPoNElJCWrjZaCC8) - good overview before creating the game
2. **Create a very bare game skeleton**
   * https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/tutorials/platformer/ (example 1, older IDE version and a few minor errors but still mostly fine to follow)
        * Part 6 has quite a few errors mainly due to the Slime image being reversed compared to the instructions, so the initial direction and horizontal flipping needs changing
   * [YouTube - Platform(er) - In Depth Tutorial - GDevelop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0d93elLHkQ) (example 2, not used but more modern one you could follow)
3. **Turn the skeleton into a playable game**
   * Creating a start and end to your game - https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/tutorials/space-shooter/13-main-menu/#series
    * https://forum.gdevelop.io/t/solved-when-i-press-a-button-to-change-the-scene-for-example-the-next-button-is-pressed-also/30752/7
4. **Add polish**
   * [YouTube - Particle Emitter ‚Äì In Depth Tutorial - GDevelop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqXYlsOENpg)
   * [YouTube - The 10 BEST Game Development Extensions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqGoJKn3XOQ)
     * "Advanced platformer movements"
     * "Camera Shake"
     * "Gamepads (controllers)"
     * "Multitouch joystick and buttons"
     * "Hexagonal grid" / "Snap objects to a virtual grid"
     * "Shake Object (position, angle, scale)" (can use for any kind of general movement, including button scaling, etc.) - useful but particles are usually easier for simple death / pickup / hit animations since they don't mess with the original object
     * "Rectangular Movement"
     * "Health (life points)"
     * "Smooth Camera" (can be used to stabilise camera when jumping)
     * "Fire bullets"
5. **Optional**
   * [JavaScript Code events](https://wiki.gdevelop.io/gdevelop5/events/js-code/) - used to keep track of total coins

* You can disable the in-game watermark in **Game properties** without needing a subscription

#### Tips
##### Performance
* Events will stop being read if the condition above is false. This means you can optimise by putting a common conditional at the top (e.g. if player is dead, then do a bunch of stuff) - doesn't automatically combine common conditionals
* Collision detection is intense so if you can use something else (like distance from object for a coin where perfect collision detection is less important), then do that instead
* If you need to display many objects, you can improve FPS by reducing animation loops or removing actions like movement
* Delete / de-activate behaviours for things that are off the screen ("Object 'Is On Screen' Detection" extension super useful)
* Be reasonable with your asset sizes
* Use tile maps for large scenes
* Keep size small
  * Can remove unused resources easily by using **Remove unused...** in the right-click menu in the **Resources** tab

### Unity
[Playable game for the source code in this repository](https://duncanscott.itch.io/2d-platformer-demo-unity)

#### Getting started
1. **Basics**
   * [.gitignore for Unity projects](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Unity.gitignore) (will need this otherwise project will be too large to commit to GitHub)
   * https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/unity-tips
   * **Official whole game tutorials** - mixed quality, Unity devs aren't great at updating older demos so there are often setup glitches or just plain bugs
     * https://unity.com/how-to/beginner-2D-game-resources
       * **Warning:** If you want to build a platformer then **none** of the official Unity tutorials are particularly great. The **Platformer Microgame** doesn't feel great and there are odd bugs. The **2D Game Kit** project is better but there are bugs and it's quite a complicated project (and the docs to help customise more deeply are poor) so fixing those bugs when adding new features is not trivial (wasted about a day on this). The **Unity Playground** is simpler and more generic, so may be a good starting point for other projects but would need a fair bit of work to get a good feeling platformer. The **Unofficial** tutorials below are much better
       * [Platformer Microgame](https://learn.unity.com/project/2d-platformer-template) - game & tutorial in one but not much depth and doesn't really tell you why things should be done. Overall the feel of the platforming isn't great and there are odd issues like this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/nc5zvx/issues_with_the_2d_platform_effector_with_unity/. It's good as an initial introduction to Unity so you can get used to the interface. The steps are quite easy to follow but you do end up with a game that relies on simple C# scripts. See later for an introduction to visual scripting
         * Initial setup fixes:
           * Due to [this bug](https://forum.unity.com/threads/why-unityhub-not-showing-other-template-files.1084937/), had to install **2021.3.27f1** to get the microgame working
           * [Install 2D packages](https://forum.unity.com/threads/2d-game-object-missing.1090024/) - some of the mods need these but don't tell you to install them
         * Mods tried:
           * 2D Platformer Mod: A Splash of Color
           * 2D Platformer Mod: Add Trails
           * Platformer Mod: Custom Triggers (remember to install 2D packages above, also easy to pick from Assets instead of Hierarchy when creating triggers, which will **not** work, so be careful)
           * 2D Platformer Mod: Paint Your Level (barely covers TileMap use, ok but not great)
           * 2D Platformer Mod: Bouncy Sparkly!
       * [2D Game Kit](https://learn.unity.com/project/2d-game-kit) - some bugs but overall a nicer experience than the microgame and the platforming feels better. Has a lot more configurability than the microgame too, so could build on this if you wanted to. Controls are a little unusual so make sure to read the instructions. Still lots of C# scripts, but a lot is exposed in the UI and the [reference page](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/2d-game-kit-reference-guide) is pretty thorough
         * Initial setup fixes:
           * Create a blank 2D project
           * Go to https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/tutorials/2d-game-kit-107098 -> Add to assets -> Open in Unity -> Download -> Import (a few clicks to get this done)
           * After Import, will see a bunch of errors about `RuleTileEditor.cs`
             1. Find and open `Assets/2DGamekit/Utilities/Editor/RuleTileEditor.cs`
             2. Replace all `RuleTile` with `RuleTile2D` in it (whole word match)
             3. Rename `RuleTile.cs` in `Assets/2DGamekit/Scripts/Utility/` to `RuleTile2D.cs` and change the `class` inside from `RuleTile` to `RuleTile2D`
             4. Restart Unity. Unity will likely complain that you have the wrong version of Unity, but you can use `2021.3.27f1` without any problems
             5. You can now proceed with the `Creating a New Scene` step in the tutorial
         * Bugs:
           * Edge of platform animation jumpiness
           * Dust particle for landing doesn't follow player and is just in middle of scene
           * VFXController is bugged so none of the effects work (possibly due to Unity version I used)
           * This may also help if you run into other issues: https://forum.unity.com/threads/2d-game-kit-official-thread.517249/page-11. However, it's clear this project isn't really supported anymore and there were bugs I found not covered in the thread
         * Notes:
           * Pre-built Zones can be found under `Assets\2DGamekit\Scenes` (need to click on folder in Project and add to Hiearchy)
           * Can change **ChestLight** light type to **Global** to light whole level
           * Disable **CMPlayerCam** to turn off player follow
           * **State Machine Behaviours (SMBs)** can be found in the Animator Controller when clicking on a state in the graph (e.g. **Chomper Patrol SMB** is attached to the **ChomperWalk** state). Visual effects (VFX) can also be found here (**Trigger VFX** component) (e.g. **ChomperDie** is attached to the **ChomperDeath** animation)
           * A PDF comes with the project which duplicates the website but also has a more detailed section that goes into how some of the deeper components work. However, it's still not very useful if you want to fully customise the project
     * [Unity Playground](https://learn.unity.com/project/unity-playground) - overall pleasant to use, comes with cheat sheets (`Assets\UnityTechnologies\Playground\Documentation`) and examples (`\Assets\UnityTechnologies\Playground\Examples`). Use the **Playground** menu to turn on / off the custom inspectors that simplify the Unity UI. [Reference guide](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/playground-reference-guide)
       * Initial setup fixes:
         * Use the 2D Core template, not 3D
     * https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/introduction-to-tilemaps
   * **Unofficial whole game tutorials** - these are much better than the official Unity ones
     * [YouTube - How to make a 2D Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=on9nwbZngyw&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR6TFcFuzI2bB7TMNIIBpKMQ) - recommended by Unity docs. The one I ended up using below was better, but there are a few worth dipping into:
       * [YouTube - How to make a 2D Game in Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=on9nwbZngyw) - nice quick intro to the basics
       * [YouTube - 2D Camera in Unity (Cinemachine Tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jTY11Am0Ig)
     * [YouTube - Build a 2D Platformer Game in Unity | Unity Beginner Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii-scMenaOQ&list=PLrnPJCHvNZuCVTz6lvhR81nnaf1a-b67U) - this is the one I ended up using in the next section, so skip to there if you want to go through it. It does involve some copy / paste coding but visual scripting is possible
   * General
     * [YouTube - Unity3D Mistakes I made that you should avoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kino_s-4mo)
   * Visual scripting
     * Since this GitHub project is meant to focus on no code and ease of use, this is an important section. Many of the resources end up touching on C#, but it's possible to use visual scripting entirely or mix visual scripting and C# in a game
     * https://learn.unity.com/project/introduction-to-visual-scripting
       * `Edit` -> `Project Settings...` -> `Visual Scripting` -> `Enable Visual Scripting`
       * Add a **Script Machine** or **State Machine** component to a **game object** to enable this (when searching in components, `Visual` won't bring it up, search for `Script` or `State`). The **Graph** contains the visual script, is an asset and can be used in multiple machines (use the **New** button in the component to start from scratch)
       * The video below is a better tutorial, so should be followed as well
       * Tips
         * You can't just drag the visual script onto a game object, create the component first and then create the link
         * White dot variables mean automatic conversions are possible
         * Graph variables can't be accessed from other graphs
         * Object variables are connected to the selected game object
         * Double click will expand the graph area
         * Right-clicking the starting point of a connector will delete it
     * [YouTube - How to Translate C# script to Visual Scripting Graph in Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waBRBKZaY9Q)
       * Tips
         * `Object` tab will only be enabled if you have attached the script to an object and have selected it
         * Use `Copy Component` and `Paste Component Values` to easily duplicate `Object` variables between game objects
         * Adding `Graph` variables to retrieve components isn't needed, happens automatically (https://forum.unity.com/threads/how-do-bolt-nodes-reference-components.1225401/) (assume this is as efficient)

   * Animations
     * Only 1st frame of animation is played:
       * This indicates an infinite loop has accidentally been created, so the state is triggered over and over. To fix this, you need to fix whatever is causing the infinite loop
       * Potential solutions:
         * Untick `Can Transition To Self` - https://discussions.unity.com/t/animator-what-does-can-transition-to-self-do/216314/2
         * Use a `Trigger` instead of a `Bool` as an animator parameter (e.g. for death transition). They both look very similar in the UI so it's easy to mix them up, but a trigger only triggers once. `Trigger`s have a circular checkbox in the UI, whereas `Bool`s have a square checkbox

     * [Best practice for particle effects in 2D pixel art games](https://imgur.com/gallery/z4Boura)
     * If you can't see your particles in the game, they're probably going into and behind the background. In some cases by default the particles will go into the background along the z-axis, so you need to rotate the particle system using the `Transform` component. It's easier to fix this in 3D mode
     * Set `Simulation Space` to `World` instead of `Local` if you want particles to not follow your game object (e.g. dust trail)

2. **Create minimal playable game**
   * After spending about a day (not included in the **Platformer tutorial** timings in table since this approach was abandoned) wrestling with the official **2D Game Kit** project and encountering various bugs while customising it (e.g. adding ability to jump on enemy heads), decided to give up on this after hitting even deeper bugs like the VFX not playing unless the scene was reloaded and the VFX appearing in the middle of the scene, amongst other things. Rather than learning about Unity, I was learning more about how the kit was built, so I decided to go back to basics and follow [YouTube - Build a 2D Platformer Game in Unity | Unity Beginner Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii-scMenaOQ&list=PLrnPJCHvNZuCVTz6lvhR81nnaf1a-b67U) to create something small as a base.

3. **Add polish**
  * Removed camera follow component
  * Added slime enemy that uses new `Enemy` tag and updated `WaypointFollower` script to allow sprite flipping
  * Added `OnPlayerDeath` and `OnLevelCompleted` so `PlayerMovement` can stop the player moving cleanly. Movement stopping is slightly different in each scenario
  * Renamed `PlayerLife` to `PlayerDamageController` and added enemy killing by jumping
  * Added more functions to `WaypointFollower` to allow clean destruction. This is handled by the death transition in the animator
  * Modified `PlayerDamageController` and `PlayerMovement` to allow jump off enemy head on kill
  * Modified `PlayerMovement` jumping to allow variable jump height (https://forum.unity.com/threads/setting-variable-jump-height-for-the-second-jump.391842/)
  * Added dust effect to `PlayerMovement`
  * Added `Checkpoint` to handle checkpoints. `CheckpointParent` used to make it easier to setup events. Event used to let player know last position. Be careful when copying the coordinates around, `Vector3` is fine to copy because it's a `struct` but `Transform` will give you a `reference` (see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/choosing-between-class-and-struct)
  * Created 1-way platforms by adding another layer and ticking `Use One Way` in the `Platform Effector 2D` component
  * `ItemCollector` now fires an event when an item is collected. Created new `FinishGated` and moved counting logic there. Moved collected item count from canvas into game world above finish flag. These work together to show the user they need to collect all the items to finish
  * Added `Fader` to fade and unfade finish flag to give an extra visual indicator that items need to be collected to unlock the flag. Also created `FaderVS` to show how visual scripting can be used in conjunction with C# scripts. They are both reasonably similar and are used in `FinishGated`
  * Replaced old input system with new input system
  * See **Final build** links above (this was more fiddly than expected due to the default WebGL template not having sensible defaults)

#### Notes
* **Glossary**
  * **Component** - contain properties which you can edit to define the behavior of a **GameObject**
  * **GameObject** - fundamental objects in Unity that represent characters, props and scenery
  * **Prefabs** - templates for **GameObject**s with preset components - basically drag a **GameObject** that's been setup to a folder, usually `Prefabs`
* **Fundamentals**
  * All game objects have a **Transform** component because they're display on the scene somewhere
* **Keyboard shortcuts**
  * **QWERTY** - these map to the editor common tool group that starts with the Hand
  * **SHIFT+F** - Zoom into currently selected game object. Or double click on the game object
  * **CTRL+D** - Duplicate the currently selected game object
  * **CTRL+P** - Play / Stop playing game
  * **TileMaps**
    * Hold **Shift** and left-click to erase a tile you just layed
    * Rotate a tile before painting by using `[` and `]`
  * Hold **CTRL** when moving a sprite to move in increments
  * Hold **ALT** when using `Rect Tool` on a sprite to resize from the centre
* **Areas**
  * **Animations**
    * Don't forget to check `Loop Time` in the inspector for the animation clip (asset with triangle icon) to make sure the animation loops
    * You can drag sprites into the animation timeline but it's a bit fiddly because sometimes it won't let you. Just make sure to select the game object and it should work
    * Usually need to change transition defaults so `Has Exit Time` is unchecked and `Transition Duration` is 0
    * Triggers are one-off events that can be used in the Animator (e.g. `death`)
    * **Animation** window
      * Dots in top right allow you to `Show Sample Rate` which will let you change the speed of the animation
    * Recording animations is easier than trying to do things programatically
  * **Audio**
    * Usually need to change audio source defaults so `Play On Awake` is unchecked
  * **Designing**
    * Using **Square**s as initial game objects mean you get a **Sprite Renderer** component added automatically, making setup slightly faster
    * Whenever you nest a game object under another game object, the Transform component becomes relative to the parent (e.g. if you put the camera under the player object, the camera will follow the player)
    * Freeze rotation Z on rigid body to stop it rotating about that plane
  * **Editor**
    * If you mess up Editor layout, can just select `Default` in the top right
    * Prefabs are highlighted in blue. Edit Prefabs by clicking on the `>` arrow on right (if you edit the game object directly it only applies to that one and not all the others)
    * When adding a new game object, check the Z value because it sometimes isn't exactly 0
    * **Hierarchy** window
      * Eye icon to left of objects lets you toggle visibility
  * **IDE** (e.g. `Visual Studio`)
    * Moving scripts around after creating them will break the intellisense so need to regenerate using `Edit` -> `Preferences` -> `External Tools` -> Select your IDE in `External Script Editor` -> Click `Regenerate project files`
  * **Inspector**
    * `?` icon takes you straight to documentation
  * **Project Settings**
    * **Input Manager** lets you rebind keys
  * **Sprites**
    * Click the sprite group (not the individual frames) to set the `Pixels Per Unit` value before working with a sprite
* **Troubleshooting**
  * When changing `UnityEvent`s, you need to setup up the serializable fields for events again otherwise you'll get strange type errors
  * **Visual Studio Code**
    * When adding new scripts, intellisense may not work for the new files. This can be fixed by regenerate the project files as per the setup steps
    * In some cases regenerating will not fix the issue, seem to be quite a few bugs here
    * Overall, the `Visual Studio` integration seems a lot more bug free, so recommend using that instead
### Rejected

https://www.reddit.com/r/unrealengine/comments/xzgv6t/is_ue_well_suited_to_2d_games/ - it seems PaperZD got bought by Epic to replace Paper2D since Paper2D hasn't been updated in a long time, so likely stick with that
Pixel 2D and PaperZD are quite loved
